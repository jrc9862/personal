    title: "The Cabot Corporation, Carbon Black Production, and Environmental Practices",
    description: "A paper that I wrote that examines The Cabot Corporation’s role in carbon black production and its environmental practices, highlighting the dual role of carbon black and fumed silica in supporting the energy transition while also contributing significantly to pollution. It details Cabot’s expansion plans, sustainability initiatives, and greenwashing in environmental messaging, concluding that while the company is investing in cleaner technologies, its core operations remain pollutive.",
