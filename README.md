This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Quick Start

**First time setup:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
./deploy.sh "your commit message"
```

**Note:** Deploy requires Node.js v20+. Currently on v18.19.1 - upgrade recommended:
```bash
# Option 1: Using nvm (recommended)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

# Option 2: System upgrade
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

## Roadmap

- dynamically source projects from my github & combine w/ projects.js
- Optimize for mobile (ik it's bad)
- Project & Writing card behavior still isn't exactly what I'm looking for
- Add resources to .json
- Add some site arrival animations
